**Project Title:** Weather App

**Motivation:** This project is to demonstrate my skills of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how to incorporate API into a program.

**Build Status:** Done/no bug

**Tech/frameworks:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Features:** The application requests the geolocation of the user and provides the weather information based on their location. The application can also convert the temperature, default as Celsius, to Farenheit. The application also provides information about the description of the weather, an icon representing the weather, and the high and low temperatures of the day. 

**Credits:**
1. OpenWeatherMap.org API
2. The Northern Block - Loew font family
3. Weather icons designed by Sihan Liu (https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/weather-color-2)
